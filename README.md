As Celestia is getting more popular , I decided to create an open-source version of her free to use/edit by anyone !

if you wish to try out the full experience of Celestia with no paid features you can try inviting the one and only Celestia from [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=795085068552896564&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

for more info and more bots join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ugpR4kr62y)

to use this bot just install the requirements by doing
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

then edit the main.py file
you will find the TOKEN variable , change it to your Discord Bot TOKEN (keep the quotation marks)

then simply run
```sh
python3 main.py
```

obviously you will need some experience with python but it shouldn't be that hard
happy discord brian-ing !
